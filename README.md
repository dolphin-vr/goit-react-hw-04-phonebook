###  Phone Book

Simple Phone Book application that can store phone contacts in LocalStorage and search in contacts list by filter.

This project is a refactoring version of [react02-phonebook](https://github.com/dolphin-vr/react02-phonebook) to using hooks instead of classes. Events, Internal state of the component and Forms (Formik+Yap) continue to be used.
